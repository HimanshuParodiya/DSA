Bubble sort

    in the Bubble sort elements are compared in pairs specifically comparing adjacent elements in the list or array 

    Here's a brief overview of how Bubble Sort works:

1) Start from the beginning of the list (or array).
2) Compare the first two elements.
3) If they are in the wrong order, swap them.
4) Move to the next pair of elements (the second and third elements) and repeat the comparison and swapping if necessary.
5) Continue this process, comparing and swapping adjacent elements, until you reach the end of the list.
6) After one pass through the list, the largest (or smallest, depending on the sorting order) element will have "bubbled up" to the end of the list.
7) Repeat steps 1 to 6 for the remaining unsorted portion of the list (excluding the already sorted elements).
8) Continue this process until no more swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is fully sorted.



Time Complexity
    best case O(n);
    worst case O(n^2)

Space Complexity
    O(1)
