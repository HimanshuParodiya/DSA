Insertion Sort

    Before jumping to our algorithm first let's see an example

Let's say we have 4 cards 
    there will be some numbers on the cards 5,2,6,9
    now we getting cards 1 by 1

    first, we get 5 number of card
        so we put it in any place 
    
    second, we get 2 we check if is it less than 5 number of card and yes it is
        so we put 2 before 5 and the array becomes 2 5

    third, we get 6 we check if is it less than  5 number of card and no it is not
        so we put 6 after 5 and the array becomes 2 5 6 
        
    fourth, we get 9 we check if is it less than 6 number of card and no it is not
        so we put 9 after 6 and the array becomes 2 5 6 9


    let's assume we get another card of number 4
    so we will check if it is bigger than 9 no then 6 no then 5 no 2 yes so we will put it after 2
    so the array will become 2 4 5 6 9

    so that was insertion sort



now let's see the approach 

    arr = [4, 12, 11, 20]

    first, we will have 4 
    then we will have 12 then we will check if 12 > 4 yes then we will put 12 after 4 then the array becomes [4,12]
    then we will have 11 then we will check if 11 > 12 no then we will put 11 before 12 then the array becomes [4,11,12]
    then we will have 20 then we will check if 20 > 12 yes then we will put 20 after 12 then the array becomes [4,11,12,20]
