Selection sort 

    array = {2,7,4,8,9,1};

    sorted array = {1,2,4,7,8,9}; it could be in increasing order or decreasing order


1) So What is Selection Sort 
        So here we just have to play different rounds because there are so many rounds/passes.
        and in each round what we do is find the smallest element and place it right place.


Now let's see an example of that:-

        We have an array = [64,25,12,22,11]

        so first we will do round 1
            in starting i is at 0th position (64)

            Round 1) Then I will place the smallest value of an array at the 0th position.
                     so the smallest value is 11, I swap the 0th element (64) with the smallest element (11)
                     array become = [11,25,12,22,64]

            Round 2) Now I will increase and reach the 1st position and now I will find the smallest value from the 1st element(25) to n - 1 which is 12
                     now again I will swap the 1st element(25) with the smallest (12).
                     array become = [11,12,25,22,64]

            Round 3) Now I will increase and reach the 2nd position and now I will find the smallest value from the 2nd element(25) to n - 1 which is 22
                     now again I will swap the 2nd element(25) with the smallest (22).
                     array become = [11,12,22,25,64]

            Round 4) Now I will increase and reach the 3rd position and now I will find the smallest value from the 3rd element(25) to n - 1 which is 25
                     now again I will swap the 3rd element(25) with the smallest (25).
                     array become = [11,12,22,25,64]

            Round 5) Now this round is not needed because there is nothing to check after the last element ;

            Total round = n - 1;


Now let's see what will be the Time Complexity of this algorithm 
    function 
        function 

Time Complexity = O(n^2);

2) best case time Complexity = O(n^2) // we can check wether it is sorted or not
worst case time Complexity = O(n^2) 

3) useCase = i) array/vector/list size is small 

so this was about selection sort
