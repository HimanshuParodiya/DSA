C++ STL stands for Standard Template Library 

    Which has built-in algorithms and Data Structure
    Example:- vectors, lists, queues, and stacks
    And sorting, searching, and manipulating data

So we can say 
C++ STL is divided into Algorithms and Containers.

1) Container
    container is also divided into 4 sections 
        1) Sequence Container:- Array, Vector, deque(double-ended queue), List and forward list.
        2) Adaptors Container:- Stack, Queue, Priority Queue.
        3) Associative Container:- Set, Map, MultiSet, MultiMap. 
        4) UnOrdered Associative:- UnOrdered Set, UnOrdered  Map, UnOrdered MultiSet, UnOrdered  MultiMap. 
       
2) Algorithms
    1) Binary Search 
    2) Lower/Upper Bound
    3) min/max
    4) reverse/rotate
    5) sort/swap etc


///////////////////////////////////////// Data Structures

1) Array = In the array, we can use (at), (empty), (front), (back) etc.
2) Vector = In the vector, we can use (capacity), (size), (front), (back), (at),(begin),(end),(insert) etc.
3) Deque(Double-Ended Queue) = We can push back and push front and also pop back and front.
4) Stack = First in last out; 
5) Queue = First in First out
5) Priority Queue = Here, the first element always will be the greatest
6) Set = Contain Unique element 
7) Map = Store value in the form of Key and value
