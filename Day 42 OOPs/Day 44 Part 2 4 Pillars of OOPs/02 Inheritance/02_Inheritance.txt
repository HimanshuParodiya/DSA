Inheritance

What is Inheritance?

Let's see the example.
Some people say you have height like your father so the height quality is Inherited from your father.

same with class. Class B will inherit some property/behavior/state/methods from class A.

Let's say we have a class named Human which has the following properties (Height, Weight, Age)

and we have 2 other objects male and female.
so male and female classes will inherit the Human properties. Then we can Implement them in our way(we will see).

Human class is a Parent/Super class for male
The male/Female class is the child/Sub class for Human

------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax

class Human{

}

class Male:access_Modifier(Private/Public) Human{

}


----------------------------------------------------------------

Mode of Inheritance

Public Mode:- Public properties of the Human class will also be Public in the male class(accessible to everyone).
Protected is similar to Private(not the same) if a property is Protected we can use it inside the class and also use it inside the child class but not outside  


Super Class(Human)          Mode                       Sub Class(Male)
Public                    ->Public->                   Public(Can be use in Male class)
Public                    ->Private->                  Private(Only use in Human class)
Public                    ->Protected->                Protected(Only used in Human and male classes)
Protected                 ->Public->                   Protected(Only used in Human and male classes)
Protected                 ->Protected->                Protected(Only used in Human and Male classes)
Protected                 ->Private->                  Private(Only used in Human and Male classes)
Private                   ->Public->                   Not Accessible(Only used in the Human class and can't be accessible for the male class)
Private                   ->Protected->                Not Accessible(Only used in the Human class and can't be accessible for the male class)
Private                   ->Private->                  Not Accessible(Only used in the Human class and can't be accessible for the male class)
