Encapsulation

What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping up data members(property/state) and functions(methods/behavior) into a single unit, and that unit is called a class.


What is a full Encapsulation class?
Where all the data members are marked private.


Why Encapsulation Advantages?
We can understand it as an information/data hider.

Advantages:- 1) we can hide the data or information of the class. For example, using private(now don't think about getter and setter). Security ⬆️
             2) we can mark our class readOnly(by using private and not using setter).
             3) we can create a reusable code(we will see how).
             4) Helpful in Unit Testing

we have already worked with it in our previous lectures. but let's do it again.
