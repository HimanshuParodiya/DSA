Destructor

Destructor is used to de-allocate the memory.

when is life-cycle of the object is near the end then the Destructor is called.

use ~ before the name of Destructor


When we declare an object using static allocation Destructor is called automatically.
But in the case of dynamic, we have to call Destructor. delete objectName;
