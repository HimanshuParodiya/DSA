Inline Functions

1) What are the Inline Functions?
ans) Inline functions are used to reduce the function call overhead.

What does that mean?

let's see the example of it.

we create a function called func and post-increment the passed a and b parameters.
and then call the function inside the main function.


// Behind the scene 

 we have a stack space 
i) Initially there is a main function inside the stack space it contains a and b
ii) then it has func() function in this function we create again a and b. and here we have allocated the new memory(memory usage)

let's go to line number 21

let's see what the inline function is doing. 
1) if the function body is one-liner we can use the inline function 
2) if the function body is 2 3 liners then it depends upon the compiler could take it as an inline 

so what does inline function mean 
look we have seen Macro which was replaced with PI. So same with inline it will replace with getMax function.

what is the use of it: i) Increase the readability
ii) no need to create a new storage or calling function in stack space because it will run before compilation.
