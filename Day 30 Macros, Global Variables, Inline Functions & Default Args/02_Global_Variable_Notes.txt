Global Variable

1) Let's say I have a variable and I want to share it between functions.

    i) I can use the Reference variable to share the variable between functions
    ii) There is another method to share the variable between functions.


ii) 2nd Method
we can create a Global variable on top of our program (before int main)  

// should we use 2nd method #STICKILY_NO this is bad practice 
this is bad practice because if any function changes its value it will reflect everywhere.

so instead of 2nd method use Reference variable (&) concept
