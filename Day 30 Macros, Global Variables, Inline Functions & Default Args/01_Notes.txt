Here we will discuss some keywords that will optimize our code.

----------------------------------------------------------------

1) Macros

We will discuss #define

i) What is #define?
ans) With #define we define/create our Macro

ii) So what is Macros?
ans) Let's understand with an example:-

So, I have written a code where I am doing some math work 
and I am using pi (π)(3.14) too much
for example
    a)Curve surface area of cone πrl 
    b)Area π*r*r

so one day we got instruction that we have to use π as 3.20
now i have to change the value of pi everywhere 

so what I can do is I can create a variable named pi and use it everywhere and if I have to change the value I will only change the variable pi 

// Let's see the cons of using a variable pi
a) we are using minimal storage/memory.

// So can we do something that doesn't require memory?

So we can create a Macro named PI
#define PI 3.14 (; is not needed)

so what is Macros?
Macro is nothing but a find-and-replace. If you you find PI in the code you will replace it with 3.14 before compilation. And this is not a variable so we didn't consume memory here. And we cant update Macros(PI = PI + 1  ...not possible)
