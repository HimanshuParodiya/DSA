Here we will solve the problem using recursion and a little bit of backtracking. 
This question is most of the time asked in D.E.Shaw


question:- https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/description/


1) Input: The input to the code is a string of digits, such as "23." Each digit corresponds to a set of letters, just like the numbers on a standard telephone keypad.

2) Output: The goal is to generate and collect all possible combinations of letters that can be formed from the given digits.

3) Approach/Intuition:

The code uses a recursive function called getCombination to generate the combinations.
It starts with an empty output string and an index that represents the position of the current digit.
The mapping vector stores the possible letters for each digit.
The recursive function explores all combinations by appending each possible letter for the current digit to the output string and moving on to the next digit.
This process continues recursively until all digits have been processed.
When the code reaches the base case (when the index exceeds the length of the input digits), it adds the current combination to the result vector.

4) Recursion Tree: The recursion can be visualized as a tree, where each node represents a recursive call, and the branches represent the different letter choices for each digit. Here's a simplified example for the input "23":

            23
     /      |       \
    a       b        c
  / | \   / | \   / | \
 ad ae af bd be bf cd ce cf


Starting with an empty string, it explores the choices for "2" (a, b, c), and for each choice, it explores the choices for "3" (d, e, f) and so on.

5) Result: The code collects all these combinations in the ans vector and prints them as a list.
