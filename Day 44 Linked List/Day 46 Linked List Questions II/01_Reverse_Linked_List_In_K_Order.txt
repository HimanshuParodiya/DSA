Reverse Linked List In K Order


// Here we have a linked list 

linkedList = 2 4 5 7 9
k = 2

so we have to Reverse nodes in pairs of 2
---------------------------------------------
// Approach Recursion

Linked List = 3 7 8 11 17 2
k = 2;

let's reverse 1st k group after that recursion will take care of it.

// solving 1st k group 
Iterative Approach (count<k)

head->next = recursive call output

return the head to the reversed linked list ====== return prev


----> Let's understand with an example

5 7 3 8

head and current is at 5
prev = null

for 1st k group, it will become

7 5 3 8

now prev = 7 
current = 3
head = 5

so head -> recursive call
