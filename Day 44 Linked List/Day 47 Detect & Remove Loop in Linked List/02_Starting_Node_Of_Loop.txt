Starting Node Of Loop

We have a linked List with a loop and we have to return the Starting node of the loop.

2->3->4->5->6->7

         10 ⬅ 9

in the above-linked list, the starting node of the loop is 5.

---------------------------------------------
Approach
(We can also use the map approach by marking visited or not)
First, Apply the Floyd Cycle Detection algorithm and find the point of intersection.
Second, Again point slow to head.
Third, slow and fast will cover 1 node at once.
now fast and slow pointers will meet again.


2->5 = A start to start point of loop
5->7 = B where slow and fast will meet
5->5 = C complete loop

as we know,
equation = distance by fast pointer = 2 distance by slow pointer

for fast pointer
A + x.C + B Here, x is the number of times C traverses C Loop.

for slow pointer
2 x (A + y.C + B) Here, y is the number of times C traverses C Loop.

putting the value of slow and fast in the above equation.

A + x.C + B = 2 x (A + y.C + B)

A + x.C + B = 2A + 2y.C + 2B

C(x-2y) = A + B

let say x-2y is k 

A + B = k times C

now listen carefully,
         A     B
2->3->4->5->6->7
        C⬆     ⬇ 
         10 ⬅ 9

A = A is a point where the loop is starting
B = B is a point where slow and fast meets
C = C is a complete circle of loop

and we have the formula,
A + B = k time C

so if 1st time fast and slow meets at B
and to reach C it requires A

because C - B = A

so what we will do to find the starting point of the loop is 

First, Apply the Floyd Cycle Detection algorithm and find the point of intersection.
Second, Again point slow to head.
Third, slow and fast will cover 1 node at once.
