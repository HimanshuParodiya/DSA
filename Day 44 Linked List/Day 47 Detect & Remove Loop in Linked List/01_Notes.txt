Detect & Remove Loop in Linked List


-------------------------------------
this one question is divided into 3 parts or it can be asked in 3 ways

1) Detect Cycle in Linked List.
2) Remove Cycle in Linked List.
3) Give the beginning/start node of the loop in the Linked List.


2->3->4->5->6->7
         ⬆     ⬇ 
         10 ⬅ 9

there is a loop in a linked list.
1) They can ask us to return the first node of loop 5.
2) Break the loop and connect 10 to null.
3) They can ask if is there any loop in a linked list.

---------------------------------------
Approach/Intuition


2->3->4->5->6->7
         ⬆     ⬇ 
         10 ⬅ 9

head = 2

1) Detect Cycle (return true or false)

1st Approach to create a map for visited or not

map<Node*, bool> visited
set every node to false and while traversing mark each node to true.
and if the next node is true that means there is a loop.
