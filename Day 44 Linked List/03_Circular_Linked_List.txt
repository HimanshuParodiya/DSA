Circular Linked List


1) What is a Circular Linked List?
// in singly Linked List 
[3] -> [5] -> [6] -> NULL


// in Circular Linked List 
    [3] -> [5] -> [6] 
    ⬆_____________⬇

In a Circular Linked List, there is no need for a head we need a tail only.

-----------------------------
// Insert the Node
Case 1) Empty List where the tail will be NULL
For that,
First, we will create a new Node.
Node *temp = new Node(data) 

Second, we will point its tail to itself.
tail = temp

Third, we will point the pointer to it  
temp->next = temp
