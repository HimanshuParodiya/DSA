Check the Linked list is palindrome or not

// now we will see the optimize approach to check that given linked list is palindrome or not

// Approach

The given linked list is
    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL 

1) We will find the middle of the linked list 
which is first 3

2) Then we will reverse the linked list after the middle element 
linked list become 
    1 -> 2 -> 3mid -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NLL 

3) Now we will put 2 pointers 1st is on head and another is no mid + 1 which is 1
and while traversing both the pointers and check if both pointers data are equal or not (now we will get if the linked list is palindrome or not)

4) Now we will repeat the 2nd step (find middle element and reverse afterwards)

now we have our original linked list
    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL
