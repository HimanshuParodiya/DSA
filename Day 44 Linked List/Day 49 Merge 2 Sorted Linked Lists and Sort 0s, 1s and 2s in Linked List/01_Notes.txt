Sort 0 1 2 in the linked list

------------------------------
Explanation

We have a Linked List that only contains 0s, 1s and 2s. 

1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> NULL

Output = 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> NULL

------------------------------
Approach

We will count the occurrence of 0s, 1s and 2s.

Number      Count
0             1 
1             2 
2             2 

now we will traverse from 0 to 2 and change the data of the original LL
