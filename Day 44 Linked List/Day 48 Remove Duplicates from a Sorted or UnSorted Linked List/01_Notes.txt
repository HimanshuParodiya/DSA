Remove Duplicates from a Sorted/Unsorted Linked List

This problem comes in two types 
1) Remove Duplicates from Sorted Linked List
2) Remove Duplicates from Unsorted Linked List


----------------------------------------------
Let's see the first problem
1) Remove Duplicates from the Sorted Linked List.

Given Linked list is  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4

Output linked list  = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

--- Approach

Let's say we have 
1 2 2 3

current and the head is pointing to 1

if the first node is not equal to the second node then go to the next node 
But if the second node is equal to the third node, remove the third node and point it to the fourth node

when First != Second, then current = current->next.
when First == Second, then current->next = current->next->next and delete the duplicate node.
