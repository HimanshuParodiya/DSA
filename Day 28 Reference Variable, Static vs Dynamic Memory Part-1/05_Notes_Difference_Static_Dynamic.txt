1) Difference between Static and Dynamic Memory allocation

// i) creating the array in both 
static  = int arr[50]; // 50 x 4 = 200
dynamic = int *arr = new int[50]; // 8(pointer size) + 50 x 4 = 8 + 200 = 208


// ii) Memory Deletion
static = memory delete/release/free by itself
dynamic = memory delete/release/free manually using delete keyword
