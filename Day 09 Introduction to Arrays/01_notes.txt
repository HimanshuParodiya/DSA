Array :- collection of same data type in one variable


// - array Declaration

int myArray[10] => there is an array of 10 values, which is named myArray


assume ---> int myArray[5] = [1,2,3,4,5]
myArray[1] = 2
myArray is showing me the base address(let assume 100) and [1] is 4x1 (4 is data type and 1 is index value) so now we will get 104 and it will print the value at address 104
so the array name is give us the address of first's (0th) address
