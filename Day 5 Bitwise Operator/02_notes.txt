---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Let shift or Right Shift

1) left shift 

5 << 1 
please shift 5 one time
so 5 => 000000000000000000000000000101
so one time shifting left = 000000000000000000000000001010 ==> 1010 => 10


another example => 3<<2

so 3 => 11 => 00000000000000011 (all 0 are close to binary number - 32)
so 2 times shifting = 00000000000001100 => 1100 => 12 


did you notice that we are multiplying by 2 here 
so is it true -----> ummmm kinda yea but not for all cases

for example if we have number like this  010000.....0010 << 1

now if we will shift to left we will see 100000.....0100
now notice that first value is 1 which indicates it is nagitive number ðŸ˜®



2) Right shift 

15 >> 1

15 => 1111 => 00000....0001111 => 00000....0000111 (1 shift to right side and nothing was there in right side so it disappera) => 0111 => 7 

another example
15 >> 2

15 => 1111 => 00000....0001111 => 00000....0000111 (2 shift to right side and nothing was there in right side so it disappera) => 0011 => 3


did you notice that here we are divding by 2
