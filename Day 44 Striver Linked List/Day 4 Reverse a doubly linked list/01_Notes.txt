Reverse a Doubly linked list

we have to Reverse the doubly linked list which has two pointers next and prev 

---------------------------------------
// 1 Brute force Approach

Null <- 1 <=> 2 <=> 3 <=> 4 <=> 5 -> Null
so the first solution that comes to my mind is will swap 5 with 1, 4 with 2 and 3 with 3 

we will take a stack data structure (which is a last-in fast-out data structure)

the head is at a temp.

we will traverse the list and put each node in the stack

the stack will contain 5 4 3 2 1 (1 comes 1st and 5 comes last in the stack)

now when the temp reaches null 

again temp will point to the head and we will take out the top element and replace it with head node data
