Class and struct
-----------------------------------
Before going to class and struct

Let's understand this

int n = 2
int* y = &n;
cout<<y;

here 2 was int and,
int* y is pointing to its address and we use int* because the data type of 2 is int.

but when we talk about a linked list in each node we have data and a pointer pointing to the next node.
how we can point a box containing data and pointer, so what type of data type is. This is where we have to define a self-defined data type.

Struct Node{
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node* (data1){
        data = data1;
        next = NULL;
    }
}

Node* node1 = new Node(5);

so this is how a self-defined data type defined

same with class 

Class Node{
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node* (data1){
        data = data1;
        next = NULL;
    }
}

differences between struct and class are struct doesn't give us the power of OOPs.

What is the memory space used in it?

        for 32-bit                          for 64-bit
        int -> 4 bytes                      int -> 4 bytes             
        * -> 4 bytes                        * -> 8 bytes
        -------------                       ------------
total  =  8 bytes                              12 bytes

so depending on the system memory usage is different.
