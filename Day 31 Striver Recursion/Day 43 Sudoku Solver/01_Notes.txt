we have to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

Rule
1) Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
2) Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
3) Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.


// Approach

ii) If there is space we will place ith (number from 1 to 9 there ) while checking if there is the same element in left right top and bottom.
iii) When we will not able to place any number at space. So, the Recursion will be over and it will return false.
iv) When sudoku is complete we will return the true 
// Remember we will not do backtracking when the return type is true because that will be my answer.
