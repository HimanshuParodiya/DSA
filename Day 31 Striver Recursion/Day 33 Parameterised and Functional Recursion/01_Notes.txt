find the sum of n natural number

we will solve this problem in two ways

1) First is parameter wise way
2) Second is a functional way

1) Parameterized way

Here we pass the result as the parameter and then return/print it.

2) Functional way

Here we don't want the parameter to do the work function return the answer. See if we pass 5 to the function we want it to return the answer (sum of n number)

Let's continue with our example

func(3)

we now n = 3 and we want the sum of n - 1 and then n - 2(for n = 3) and at the end when n = 0 we will write base case n==0 return 0 

so we can do 
return n + func(n - 1)
