Recursion

1) What is Recursion?
ans) when a function calls itself until a specified condition is met.

fun(){
    fun();
}
but this will run infinitely 
to prevent it we have to specify the condition when we have to terminate this function. This condition is called the base condition.

there can be single base conditions and multiple base conditions we will see later. ðŸ™‚
