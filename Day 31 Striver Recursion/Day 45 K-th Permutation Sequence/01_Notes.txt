K-th Permutation Sequence 
link:- https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/

// In this problem we have given a number n(n = 3 = {1,2,3}) and we have to find its kth permutation

for n = 3
1) "123"
2) "132"
3) "213"
4) "231"
5) "312"
6) "321"

k = 4 output = "231
the total number of permutations is n!

// so first, the brute force approach is 
1) find all the permutations 
2) store in data structure 
3) Sort the data structure 
4) get the kth permutation by dataStructure[k - 1]

Time complexity = O(n! x n )+ O(n! Log n!) (n! for getting all the permutations and n for storing them in the data structure then n! Log n! for sorting algorithm )

//Now the interviewer will ask to optimize it 

// optimize

1) n = 4, k = 17
= {1,2,3,4}

I can pick 1 = rest will be {2,3,4} so there will be 6 permutations which will start with 1 (6 because there are 3 numbers in {} so they will permute in themself that will be 3! = 6 )

I can pick 2 = rest will be {1,3,4} so there will be 6 permutations which will start with 2

I can pick 3 = rest will be {1,2,4} so there will be 6 permutations which will start with 3

I can pick 4 = rest will be {1,2,3} so there will be 6 permutations which will start with 4

n = 4, k = 17
= {1,2,3,4}


so in 0-based indexing 
there will be 6 permutations for index 0-5 
there will be 6 permutations for index 6-11 
there will be 6 permutations for index 12-17 
there will be 6 permutations for index 18-23 


we have to find the 17th permutation but because there is 0-based indexing we are looking for the 16th permutation 



k = 16, The total permutation for each is 6
16/6 = 2 

2nd index of {1,2,3,4} = 3
so, the first number will be 3 rest {1,2,4}

answer = 3
there will be 6 permutations for index 12-17

16%6 = 4

our answer will be the 4th index from 12









2) k = 4
rest = {1,2,4}

my permutation will start from 1 rest {2,4} there will be 2 permutations index 0-1
my permutation will start from 2 rest {1,4} there will be 2 permutations index 2-3
my permutation will start from 4 rest {1,2} there will be 2 permutations index 4-5


k = 3, The total permutation for each is 2
3/2 = 2 

2nd index of {1,2,4} = 4
so, the first number will be 4 rest {1,2}
answer = 3,4
4%2 = 0







k = 0
rest = {1,2}

my permutation will start from 1 rest {2} there will be 1 permutation index 0-0
my permutation will start from 2 rest {1} there will be 1 permutation index 1-1

k = 0, The total permutation for each is 0
0/2 = 0
0th index of {1,2} = 1
so, the first number will be 1 rest {2}
answer = 3,4,1
0%0




k = 0
rest = {2}

my permutation will start from 2 rest {} there will be 0 now pick up this number (2)

answer = 3,4,1,2






conclusion kth/permutation = pick that indies element and push in the answer
