1) Linear Search 

    let say we have an array = [3,4,6,7,8,-2]
    and we have to find 2 in this array 

    so what we will do we will create a loop and iterate each element of an array and check if that element is equal to 2 
    here time complexity will be O(n)

    so we are working fine here even time complexity is good.
    so, what is the need of binary search. 

    lets see.
