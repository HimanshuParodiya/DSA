Linear Search Vs Binary Search 

1) Linear Search

    if we have 1000 value than the worst case(BigO N) can be 1000 comparison.

2) Binary Search

    if we have 1000 value which is shorted than the first time it get 500 then 250 then 125 then 62 then 31 then 15 then 7 then 3 then 1 then 0
    total = 1000,500,250,125,62,31,15,7,3,1 = 10 comparison






complexity of logn ==== 

In the context of data structures and algorithms (DSA), you are more likely to encounter and use logarithm base 2, which is often denoted as log2


To approximate log2(1000) manually, you can use the following method. We'll use successive approximations:

Start with an initial approximation, let's say x = 9.

Calculate 2^x:
2^9 = 512

Check if the result is greater or smaller than 1000. In this case, 512 is smaller than 1000.

To get closer to 1000, increase x by 1:
x = 10

Calculate 2^x:
2^10 = 1024

Now, check if the result is greater or smaller than 1000. In this case, 1024 is greater than 1000.

To get a closer approximation, we need to refine it further. We can use linear interpolation to estimate the fraction of the step needed to reach 1000.

Fraction = (1000 - 512) / (1024 - 512) = 488 / 512 ≈ 0.953

Add this fraction to the current value of x:
x = 10 + 0.953 ≈ 10.953

So, manually approximating log2(1000) using this method gives us approximately 10.953. This is a relatively close approximation to the actual value of log2(1000), which is approximately 9.966.
