Modular
if we module a with n ==> a%n ==> so our output will be lies between 0 to n-1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Basic" arithmetic
First off, some important identities about the modulo operator:

(a % m) + ( b % m) % m = (a+b)  % m
(a % m) âˆ’ (b % m) % m = (aâˆ’b)  % m
(a % m) â‹… (b % m) % m = (aâ‹…b)  % m


Sometimes interviewer or anyone(Even in competitive Programming) can ask us to print your in the form of 10 power9 + 7 ==> 10^9 + 7

Question => so why do they ask to print answers in this form 
Answer => On Day 8 file number 7 we are printing factorial but there we are using 2 long what if we use int instead of 2 long now print a factorial of 20 
so the answer will exceed the limit of int. 

So to get rid of the overflow we can use mod and ask them to print the answer in the form 10^9 + 7 

i) (a+b) % m = a%m + b%m
ii) (a-b) % m = a%m - b%m
iii) (a x b) % m = a%m x b%m

now we can use them
But how we can use them ðŸ™‚

for that, we gonna learn about fast exponentiation so we can use these formulas

the time complexity of fast exponentiation is O(logn)
