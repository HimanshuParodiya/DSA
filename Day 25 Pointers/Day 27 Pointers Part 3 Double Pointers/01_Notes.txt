first, let's do a quick revision 


// create a pointer for i
int i = 5;
int *ptr = &i;



// Why do we need double-pointers

when we want to create a pointer corresponding to I we create a pointer but when we want to create a pointer corresponding to a pointer we use a double pointer


//How to declare a double pointer?
int i = 5;
int *ptr = &i;
int **double_Ptr =  &ptr;


// Double Pointers with function
