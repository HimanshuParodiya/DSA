Minimum cost to make valid string

given string = "{{{}" 

we can convert the { to }

so we have to make it valid string.

in above case we just have to convert  {{ to {} te the given string will be valid string. answer will be 1

for {{}{}} answer will be 0.


conditions 
1) no. of open = no of clone.
2) every close brace should have open brace before it.


// Approach

case 1 
    if the given string size is odd then we can make it valid string.
    then we will return -1.

case 2
